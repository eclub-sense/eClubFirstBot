This is the first attempt to build a bot on Facebook. I have followed the steps Jerry Wang has described in his blog https://medium.com/chat-bots/have-15-minutes-create-your-own-facebook-messenger-bot-481a7db54892#.de1jqus3m
It is a very helpful guide for writing an initial bot.

Current version only replies with the entered text, except when you type eClub. In response to eClub a 1,2,3, steps to join eClub are displayed.

I will continue with making the bot more intelligent before I ask for Fscebook approval.
